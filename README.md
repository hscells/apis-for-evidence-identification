# Using APIs to help automate information retrieval for evidence identification

_This invited workshop was part of [IQWiG](https://www.iqwig.de/en/)'s [Information Retrieval Meeting 2024](https://www.iqwig.de/en/events/information-retrieval-meeting/)_

This is the supplementary material for the workshop. It includes interactive notebooks that can be run in your browser. The notebooks let you edit and play with the code and data that are used in the workshop.

More and more APIs (application programming interfaces) are used as programmatic interfaces for certain databases or data sets. This workshop explains what an API is and what knowledge is necessary to use them, for example:

 - what APIs are and how they work
 - offline versus online APIs
 - using APIs via Python

The focus of this workshop is to present use cases especially for APIs that are already available. This workshop explains what API use cases exist, what they are used for and how average information specialist can use them.
