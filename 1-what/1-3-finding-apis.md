# 1.3 Finding APIs

Actually finding how to access APIs in the first place can be quite difficult. All of the APIs that we will explore in this workshop, including some additional ones, are listed in the table below.

| PubMed (Entrez)     | The E-utilities are the public API to the NCBI Entrez system and allow access to all Entrez databases including PubMed, PMC, Gene, Nuccore and Protein. The E-utilities are a suite of eight server-side programs that accept a fixed URL syntax for search, link and retrieval operations. A companion package named Entrez Direct consists of several executables that allow the E-utilities to be called directly from a UNIX command line. | [documentation](https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)<br/>[quick start](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25500/)<br/>[examples](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25498/)<br/> |
| ClinicalTrials.gov  | ClinicalTrials.gov is a database of privately and publicly funded clinical studies conducted around the world.
