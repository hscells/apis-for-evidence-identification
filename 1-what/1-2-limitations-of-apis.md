# 1.2 Limitations of APIs

APIs are a powerful tool for automating lots of things, including information retrieval, but they have limitations.

## Accessibility

Not all APIs are free to use. Some APIs require a subscription or payment to access. Some APIs are only available to certain users or organizations. Some APIs have rate limits, which restrict the number of requests you can make in a given time period. Some APIs have usage limits, which restrict the amount of data you can access. Some APIs have restrictions on the types of data you can access or how you can use the data.

While all the APIs we'll be using in this workshop are free to use, it's important to be aware of these limitations when working with APIs. Excessive use of an API can result in your access being restricted or revoked, especially for free APIs.

## Data Privacy

When you use an API, you are sending and receiving data over the internet. This data can be intercepted or monitored by third parties. It's important to be aware of the privacy and security implications of using APIs, especially when working with sensitive or confidential data.

The best way to protect your data when using APIs is to use secure connections (HTTPS) and to follow best practices for data security. This includes encrypting your data, using strong passwords, and keeping your software up to date. It can be easy to send sensitive data over an insecure connection, so it's important to be vigilant when working with APIs.

## Complexity

APIs can be complex to work with, especially if you're not familiar with the underlying technology. APIs can have a steep learning curve, and it can take time to understand how to use them effectively. APIs can also be difficult to troubleshoot, especially if you encounter errors or unexpected behavior. It's important to be patient and persistent when working with APIs, and to seek help if you get stuck.

This workshop tries to start from the basics and build up to more complex topics, so you can learn how to use APIs effectively. We'll cover the basics of APIs, including how to find them, how to use them, and how to troubleshoot common problems. We'll also provide examples and exercises to help you practice using APIs in a safe and controlled environment.

All of the later chapters that have some programming component will be using Python. That being said, the content is written in such a way that you should still be able to play around with the interactive code cells even if you're not familiar with Python.
